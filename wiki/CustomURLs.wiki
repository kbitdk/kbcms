#summary URLs can be fully customized, which has a variety of benefits

= Introduction =
In KB CMS you can name the pages as you like and make them available with any name you want.

= Benefits =
This feature can have several benefits:
 * Makes migrating from another CMS or a custom website easier
  * You can name the new pages exactly as they were before, regardless of how the naming scheme was
 * Makes SEO (Search Engine Optimization) of URL's fully in your control
  * Search engines will gather important keywords and contextual info from the URLs of the pages
  * Search results for your website will look clearer, as the URLs show the tiers of the results
 * Gets rid of the traditional way of showing all pages as .html or .php files and all images as .jpg or .png files

= Precedence =
The precedence of the URLs ensure that certain pages, like the admin page and the sitemap can always be shown, even if a page has been manually named the same as those pages. The precedence is as follows, with the highest priority first:

 * */favicon.ico* - hardcoded in the .htaccess file
 * */sitemap.xml* - hardcoded in the index.php file
 * */admin* - the actual URL is configurable in config.xml
 * *pages* - any page in the index.xml file
 * *media* - any media in the index.xml file
