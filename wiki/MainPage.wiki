#summary Introduction to this project.

= Introduction =

KB CMS is a PHP5-based CMS aimed at easy setup and maintenance. It divides the content and design into XML and XSL files.

= Status =
KB CMS can display websites based on XML and XSL files and is therefore a working website manager. It doesn't have an admin interface yet, though, so it's not really a proper CMS yet.

= Features =
 * Content and design separation into XML and XSL files
 * *Fully* customizable URL's

= Todo =
 * Admin interface (with a TinyMCE editor)
 * Run through all the TODO notes in the code
