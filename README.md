# Introduction #
KB CMS is a Go-based CMS aimed at easy setup and maintenance without sacrificing functionality.

# Status #
KB CMS is in the process of being rewritten in Go. The last working version was 0.2.5, which was in PHP.
The repository is in alpha and might not do much for you, just yet.
<!--
KB CMS is now in beta and it's usable. It needs some documentation and there are lots of features to implement. Any help is greatly appreciated.
-->

# Requirements #
  * Go

# Features #
  * Licensed under the GPL version 2 or later (except the name and logo - give it your own touch)
    * Use it for as many sites as you like and customize it all you want
  * Content and design separation
