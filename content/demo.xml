		<h1>Demonstration</h1>
		This CMS makes it easier to manage objects on your website, whether you want to edit it from the admin interface or the source files.
		<br/><br/>
		The URL's for both the pages and the images and media on the site are fully customisable. This makes it possible to give prettier URL's and more customisability for search engine optimisation. As an example, the relative URL for this image is "/Test":
		<br/><br/>
		<img src="Test"/>
		<h2>Source demonstration</h2>
		If you edit the pages by source, there are some benefits to quickly gain from. You can insert normal HTML in the XML files for full compatibility and ease of use. This can be extended with your own set of tags through XSL stylesheets.
		<br/><br/>
		This example shows how an employee list can be made entirely from custom XML tags that are then translated via the XSL file to proper HTML:
		<br/><br/>
		<KBEmployeeList>
			<employee>
				<name>John Doe</name>
				<department>Security</department>
				<extension>112</extension>
			</employee>
			<employee>
				<name>Jane Doe</name>
				<department>Accounting</department>
				<extension>482</extension>
			</employee>
		</KBEmployeeList>
